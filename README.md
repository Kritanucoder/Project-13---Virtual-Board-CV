# Project-13---Virtual-Board-CV

This project implements an innovative virtual painting application using computer vision and hand gesture recognition to create digital artwork through natural hand movements. The system utilizes MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and OpenCV for image processing, enabling users to paint in mid-air using finger gestures. The application features a comprehensive interface with multiple drawing modes: selection mode (index and middle fingers extended) for color choosing, and drawing mode (index finger only) for painting. Users can select from various colors including pink, blue, green, and an eraser function through an interactive header interface. The system provides dual visualization with a 50-50 split display showing live camera feed and the drawing canvas simultaneously. Advanced features include adjustable brush thickness, eraser functionality with increased thickness, canvas clearing capability, and real-time drawing feedback. This touchless painting system demonstrates practical applications in digital art creation, interactive education, and accessibility solutions for users with physical limitations.
